# Synthetic World 10
Synthetic World's seventh Forge-based modpack, this pack is built to be more of a crowd pleaser than our previous few packs. With an emphasis on exploration, it has something to offer for every type of player.

### Note:
- Synthetic World 10 will only recieve support for Minecraft 1.20.1. Future Minecraft version support is not planned. [Synthetic World 9](https://github.com/SyntheticMediaGroup/Synthetic-World/tree/v9) is the latest LTS release at the time of writing.
- This version REQUIRES the Prism Launcher. MultiMC will no longer be supported. If you wish to retain your old instances, [a migration guide is available](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/migrating-multimc/) and is quick and easy to follow.
- With version 9, Synthetic World dropped the `v` from it's release names. If this offends you, rename your packs.
